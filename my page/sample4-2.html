            Most computer engineering jobs require at least a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. Many employers also require state certification as a professional engineer (PE).
            A master's degree is often required for promotion to management, and ongoing education and training are needed to keep up with advances in technology.
             Many computer engineers belong to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society.

           The BLS predicts employment of computer hardware engineers to grow 7 percent from 2012 to 2022, which is slower than the average for all occupations.
            "A limited number of engineers will be needed to meet the demand for new computer hardware because more of the technology innovation takes place with software than with hardware," the BLS states. Employment of software developers is projected to grow 22 percent from 2012 to 2022, which is much faster than the average for all occupations.
            "The main reason for the rapid growth is a large increase in the demand for computer software," according to the BLS. Having good grades from a highly rated institution should give a job seeker an advantage over the competition.
